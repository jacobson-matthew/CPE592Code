2) Which one you will prefer to use "Data Encryption" or "WaterMarking"?  
Please write down one scenario for each of these mechanisms when one is preferred 
over the other.  (5 points)

I personally prefer encryption because you cant replicate what you cant access. While 
encryption has its downfalls when you want media to be shareable, I think that confidentiality
of information is very import.

In the case where data encryption is better over watermarking is when you want to 
keep the confidentiality of the information secure from an unathorized user. Lets
say a message is watermarked but not encrypted, the adversary can still view the 
secret information and if we see his message we know he intercepted it because it has 
our watermark. But regardless the adversary can still see the secret information contained inside 
the message and if it is time sensitive this could be very detrimental

In the next case where watermarking is better over encryption is the case when
you want the information to be available but uniquely identified. The most common example
of this is sharing photos on the internet. Let's say you are a photographer and you want to post 
your pictures on your professional website. You dont want to encrypt the information because
you want it to be visible to others but you also dont want your work to be easily reproduceable. 
Watermarking is the optimal solution for this by uniquely identifying it and not allowing the watermark to be 
easily removed.
