For each of the techniques I chose the first row of pixels for simplicity which increased the readability of my program. 
I was able to make the calculations and changes (which have been outputted to the console properly), but because python 
is not my best lanugage I was unable to figure out and debug why my program wouldn't save the pixels back to the image properly. 
As you can see through my comments, I demonstrate that I know how to preform LSB and MSB stenography but unfortunately because of the lack 
of my python skills I was unable to make it save the image properly. 

Based on my experiences and testing outside of this program, LSB stenography changes the image pixels very little and with MSB it can 
cause signifigant changes to the bits and the image causing discoloration and can cause big changes in rgb information because of the change
of the most signifigant bit. 

for my program I used my name "Matthew Jacobson" as the secret information to be encoded.
