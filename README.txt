Assignment 1: 

Take any picture using your smartphone and use it for experiments. Late homework
submissions will not be accepted in order to be fair to those who submit their work on
time.

1. Hide your name (first and last name) in the image.

(a) Use the least significant bit (LSB) steganography technique. That is, convert your
full name into bit representation and replace the LSB of image pixels by this bit stream.
Choose any set of consecutive pixels (stego key) for this experiment.

(b) Use most significant bit (MSB) steganography technique. That is, replace the
most significant bits of a consecutive set of image pixels by your bit stream. Do you notice
any difference? If so, what is the difference and give a reason for this. Submit your
software program(s), LSB stego image (in bmp or jpg format), MSB stego image (bmp or
jpg format), and the secret (stego) key. Write the reasoning asked in part (b).

(c) Submit your source code, input image, and output stego images.

Assignment 2: 

1) Write a program to encrypt and decrypt your full name using RSA encryption. Use the parameters provided in the example given in the course notes (RSA.pdf) (5 points)

2) Which one you will prefer to use "Data Encryption" or "WaterMarking"?  Please write down one scenario for each of these mechanisms when one is preferred over the other.  (5 points)
